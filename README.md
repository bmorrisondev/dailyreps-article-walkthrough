# Daily Reps ðŸ‘‹

Daily Reps is a day-to-day workout tracker that allows users to track the combined number of reps that one performs on a given day, resetting the logged reps for the following day.

This repository is the sample covered in the [**Build a daily workout tracker with Clerk, Convex, and Expo**](https://expo.dev/blog/build-a-daily-workout-tracker-with-clerk-convex-and-expo) on the Expo blog.
